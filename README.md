# RGB Filter

An application to load an image from file and then apply simple filters on a per-pixel basis.

This is the C# version of the application with Windows Forms GUI elements.

## Inspiration

My younger son came to me and out of the blue asked me if I knew what RGB pixel encoding was. I said I did, and he told me that he had a theory, that if you took the Red, Green abd Blue values for each pixel in an image, averaged them, and then set all three values to the averaged value, the result would be the original image in black and white.

I told him that I couldn't imagine where he got that theory from or why he thought it would work that way but that I could absolutely write a Windows application to test his theory.

I wrote the application in C++ as I was familiar with Windows GUI application development with C++ from prior work experience.

He was of course right--we changed a bunch of family photos to black and white and got a real kick out of it. Since it was pretty easy from there, we added some more basic filters.

This is pretty much that same application but written in C# as an exercise in improving my C# skills.
